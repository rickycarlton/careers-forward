		<p>Is your company in the process of continuously filling the same positions over and over from the same talent pool? Are you spending the majority of your time on the administration of processes associated with filling open positions? Does your company call this process “recruiting”?</p>
		<p>If the answer is yes, then you most likely have a system in place that is meeting your needs. If the answer is maybe at best or flat out no, then an opportunity to improve your current process exists. Careers Forward can assist your company in that process.</p>

				<h3 class="tc-slate-light">1. On-Site Assessment</h3>
				<p class="mts mbf">We invest our time into learning your business model and your businesses culture. Our Recruiting Partners, or RP’s for short, perform an on-site assessment, working with your human resources team to do a “deep dive” -- or cultural audit -- of your company’s culture.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="g-b--os g-b--m--10of12">
				<h3 class="tc-slate-light">2. Cultural Fit</h3>
				<p class="mts mbf">We find people that not only have the skill set to do “the job” but also align with your company culture. These become employees with more value to your company; they want to grow within your organization and ultimately help your business grow as well. They are committed and have bought into your “culture.”</p>

				<h3 class="tc-slate-light">3. Structured Interview Guides</h3>
				<p class="mts mbf">We customize our approach to filling a position using information gathered in our on-site assessment. Potential employees complete Structured Interview Guides, or SIG’s for short. Questions that relate to your company culture are built into our screening tools as we look for your “right fit talent.”</p>

				<p class="mts mbf">We work with you to add assessment tools that assist in screening for “right fit talent.” You meet/interview only the candidates that are a skill set match to the position and cultural match to your company. No wasted time for anyone involved.</p>
